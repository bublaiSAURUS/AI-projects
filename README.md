# COMP24011 2023 Labs

This is the repo for COMP24011 labs in the academic session 2023-24.

There is a branch for each of the 4 lab assignments.
These are called: `lab1`, `lab2`, `lab3`, `lab4`.
To access the files for a lab you need to switch to the corresponding branch.
For example, you can use the command
```
git checkout lab1
```

Every branch has a refresh script to fetch the lab materials when they become available.
You **must** run this script before you start working on the assignment.
This can be done with the command
```
./refresh.sh
```

To submit your work you need to follow the coursework instructions in the [CS Handbook](https://wiki.cs.manchester.ac.uk/index.php/UGHandbook23:Coursework#Developing_and_submitting_with_Gitlab).
You **must** use the correct git tag which you can find in the manual for the lab.

Please ask for support in the lab sessions if you're unsure about lab submission or instructions.
